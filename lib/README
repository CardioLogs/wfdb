This directory contains sources for the WFDB library.  Please look at the
README file in the directory above this one before installing the WFDB library.

If a `make' utility is available, follow the instructions in the appropriate
`make' description file (see the list below) to compile and install the WFDB
library on your system.  If you do not have a `make' utility, you will have to
perform the installation manually;  the comments in the `make' files may be
helpful in determining how to proceed.  For information about using the
library, see the WFDB Programmer's Guide (TeX source in the `doc' directory at
the same level as this one).

The following files will be found in this directory:

COPYING.LIB	the GNU Library General Public License
makelib		UNIX `make' description file for compiling the WFDB library
		 without NETFILES support (copy to `Makefile' before use)
netmake		UNIX `make' description file for compiling the WFDB library
		 with NETFILES support (copy to `Makefile' before use)
Makefile-dos-gcc UNIX `make' description file for compiling the WFDB library
		 for MS-DOS using a gcc cross-compiler under UNIX
Makefile.dos	MS-DOS `make' description file for compiling the WFDB library
		 using Microsoft `make' or `nmake', Borland `make', etc.

What next?
----------

Once you have installed the WFDB library, read the `README' file in the `app'
directory on the same level as this one for instructions on compiling and
installing the standard WFDB applications.
