This directory contains a "micro-database" which can be used to test
programs compiled with the WFDB library.  To make the files in this directory
accessible to such programs, add the name of this directory to the database
path, or copy them into a directory which is already in the database path
(for more information, see the WFDB Programmer's Guide).
	
The following files will be found in this directory:
