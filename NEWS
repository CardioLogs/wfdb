10.2.2:
	WAVE can now be used to view and edit annotations for records that
	have no signals.

	The WAVE User's Guide has been moved to the 'doc' directory, and
	the process of formatting it is now better integrated with that for
	the other WFDB guides.

10.2.1:
	Most users will no longer need to set the WFDB path explicitly, as a
	result of several minor changes in the default path and in the
	installer for the WFDB Software Package.

	The environment variable WFDBNOSORT was replaced by WFDBANNSORT, and
        the environment variable WFDBGVMODE was introduced (see 'Annotation
        Order' and 'Multi-Frequency Records', in the WFDB Programmer's Guide,
	for details).

10.2.0:
	The 10.2 series differs from all earlier releases in that the WFDB
	library no longer imposes any fixed limits on the numbers of annotators
	or signals that can be open simultaneously.  There is also no
	fixed limit on the number of samples per signal per frame.  The
	constants WFDB_MAXANN, WFDB_MAXSIG, and WFDB_MAXSPF, which determined
	these limits in previous versions of the library, are still defined in
	lib/wfdb.h for compatibility with older programs that use them, e.g.,
	to set array sizes.

	In this release, almost all of the WFDB applications, including WAVE,
	those in the 'app' and 'examples' directories, and convert/edf2mit,
	have been revised so that they can handle arbitrary numbers of signals
	and (where applicable) annotation files.  The exceptions are:

	  sample
	    limited by the number of channels provided by the ADC/DAC it uses
	  view, wview
	    use 'gtkwave' (http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/beta/gtkwave)

	Also please note the new 'checkpkg' directory, which contains a variety
	of tests to check the basic functionality of the WFDB library and many
	of the WFDB applications.  From the base directory, run the tests by:

		make check

	These tests will check the currently installed version of the WFDB
	software package.  If you use them to check an old version, there may
	be minor discrepancies because of changes in the output formats;  you
	should not encounter any discrepancies if you use these tests after
	installing this version of the WFDB software package.

	As always, your comments are welcome!
