10.2.6:
	Added setifreq() to the WFDB library.  This function allows the
	caller to resample an input record at any convenient sampling
	frequency, using getvec() to perform xform's resampling algorithm
	transparently.  Thanks to Pat Hamilton for the inspiration!
	NOTE:  The application must still keep track of the original
	sampling frequency if it needs to read or write annotations, since
	annotation times are in (unresampled) sample intervals in this
	release.

	Added 'wfdb-config', a tiny program (in app) that reports the WFDB
	library version and linking information (similar to libwww-config,
	gtk-config, etc.).

	The WFDB library now records the base time with millisecond precision
	(previous versions did so with one-second precision), and 'xform'
	provides starting times to the library function 'setbasetime' with
	millisecond precision.  Thanks to Allavatam Venuopal for providing
	examples that illustrated the need for these features.

	Fixed handling of absolute time strings in 'ann2rr', 'bxb', 'epic',
	'fir', 'ihr', 'mxm', 'pscgen', 'rdann', and 'rxr' (all in app).

	Fixed deskewing buffer initialization in getframe() (in lib/signal.c).
	broken by 10.2.0 update, which introduced an infinite loop when
	reading a record that requires skew correction starting at sample 0.
	Thanks to Andrew Walsh for finding an example that triggered this bug.

10.2.5:
	New output format options in 'ann2rr' and 'ihr'.

	FreeBSD support in 'configure', new conf/freebsd* (thanks to
	Giuseppe Pagnoni).

	Added support for annotation maps from wfdb/ecgmap.h to the Fortran
	wrappers (fortran/wfdbf.c) and fixed two typos there.

	Removed unneeded references to wfdb/wfdb.h from waverc/wave-remote.c
	and waverc/wavescript.c (thanks again to Giuseppe Pagnoni).

10.2.4:
	Bug fixes in 'pschart' and 'psfd' (vbuf was not properly initialized
	before its first use).

10.2.3:
	Portability fixes in 'configure', 'install.sh', 'wave/Makefile.tpl',
	'psd/hr*', 'doc/*.sh', 'lib/wfdblib.h', and 'checkpkg/*check'.

	Updated 'checkpkg/appcheck' to use WFDBANNSORT when testing 'sortann'.

	The full package is now much smaller because the figures for the
	WAVE User's Guide are now generated as needed from compressed ppm
	files.  Also, 'doc/texindex.c' and 'doc/texi2html' have been removed
	from the package (these are now more widely available than when they
	were originally included, and relatively few users need them).

	Added rules for creating 'dbu.hlp' (MS-Windows help file version of
	the WFDB Programmer's Guide) to doc/Makefile.tpl.  Updated rules for
        generating the info version of the Programmer's Guide.

	Special pipe and tape header files from 'data' are now installed
	by default.

	Added rules for creating WFDB source and binary RPMs to the top-level
	Makefile.tpl.

10.2.2:
	WAVE can now be used to view and edit annotations for records that
	have no signals.

	The WAVE User's Guide has been moved to the 'doc' directory, and
	the process of formatting it is now better integrated with that for
	the other WFDB guides.

	In 'ihr', the use of an uninitialized variable ('lasttime') caused
	some non-outlier data in the first few samples to be rejected
	incorrectly.  This has now been fixed.

10.2.1:
	Most users will no longer need to set the WFDB path explicitly, as a
	result of several minor changes in the default path and in the
	installer for the WFDB Software Package.

	The environment variable WFDBNOSORT was replaced by WFDBANNSORT, and
        the environment variable WFDBGVMODE was introduced (see 'Annotation
        Order' and 'Multi-Frequency Records', in the WFDB Programmer's Guide,
	for details).

10.2.0:
	The 10.2 series differs from all earlier releases in that the WFDB
	library no longer imposes any fixed limits on the numbers of annotators
	or signals that can be open simultaneously.  There is also no
	fixed limit on the number of samples per signal per frame.  The
	constants WFDB_MAXANN, WFDB_MAXSIG, and WFDB_MAXSPF, which determined
	these limits in previous versions of the library, are still defined in
	lib/wfdb.h for compatibility with older programs that use them, e.g.,
	to set array sizes.

	In this release, almost all of the WFDB applications, including WAVE,
	those in the 'app' and 'examples' directories, and convert/edf2mit,
	have been revised so that they can handle arbitrary numbers of signals
	and (where applicable) annotation files.  The exceptions are:

	  sample
	    limited by the number of channels provided by the ADC/DAC it uses
	  view, wview
	    use 'gtkwave' (http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/beta/gtkwave)

	Also please note the new 'checkpkg' directory, which contains a variety
	of tests to check the basic functionality of the WFDB library and many
	of the WFDB applications.  From the base directory, run the tests by:

		make check

	These tests will check the currently installed version of the WFDB
	software package.  If you use them to check an old version, there may
	be minor discrepancies because of changes in the output formats;  you
	should not encounter any discrepancies if you use these tests after
	installing this version of the WFDB software package.

	As always, your comments are welcome!
