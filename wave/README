This directory contains sources for `wave', an X11/XView-based program for
analyzing and viewing database records and editing annotation files.  For more
information about `wave', type `make help' in this directory, and read `wave.1'
in the `doc' directory at the same level as this one.  Read `Makefile' in this
directory for information about compiling and installing `wave'.

The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile	UNIX `make' description file

Wave.res	default X11 resource file
analysis.hlp	on-line help for Analyze panel and menu files
analyze.c	analysis functions

annpan.c	functions for the annotation template panel
anntab		examples of user-defined annotation types
bitmaps.h	icon and cursor bitmaps
buttons.hlp	on-line help for command buttons
demo.txt	information text for WAVE demo mode
edit.c		annotation-editing functions
editing.hlp	on-line help for editing functions

What next?
----------

The `Makefile' in this directory can be used to automate compilation and
installation of `wave'.  Normally this is done by a nested `make' invoked
from within the `makefile' in the `wfdb' directory (the parent of this one).
See the `README' file in that directory for further information.

Your comments and suggestions are welcome;  please send them to me at the
address above, by e-mail if possible.

If you use WAVE remotely, reports of window manager, X server, or network
software incompatibilities (or compatibilities!) would be greatly appreciated.
If you attempt to port WAVE to a new environment, please write to me to be
sure of getting the most recent sources and to avoid duplication of effort in
case your port is in progress or already finished.

Please fill in and return the registration card to be kept informed of updates.
