Please try out this demonstration!  Move the mouse pointer
over any control and press the `Help' key (at the lower
left corner of the keyboard), or the `F1' key if there is
no `Help' key, for information about that control.  Most
controls are activated using the left mouse button;  menus
are opened using the right mouse button.
