WFDB Software Package installation notes

These notes are included here for those who may not have ready access to the
World Wide Web.  For those who do, please visit PhysioNet, where quick-start
guides including installation notes for popular operating systems are available
(see http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml).

_______________________________________________________________________________

Under UNIX or Linux:

1. Install the World Wide Web Consortium's libwww library (you will need both
   the library itself and the developer's package;  download them from
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/libwww/, or from the W3C's web site
   at http://www.w3.org/Library).  You may skip this step if you don't want
   support for reading input files from remote web and FTP servers.  See
   README.NETFILES for further information about this option.

2. Install the XView library (see http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/xview/)
   if you want to use WAVE, and be sure that the directory that contains the
   XView application 'textedit' (usually /usr/openwin/bin) is in your PATH.
   For information about WAVE, see the WAVE User's Guide,
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/.

   WAVE uses Netscape (or another web browser, if you've made the appropriate
   changes in waverc/Makefile) for some of its on-line help.  Copy the
   contents of http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/ into
   /usr/local/help/html/wug if you wish to read the help from local files;
   otherwise, edit wave/wave.info and change all occurrences of
   '/usr/local/help/html/' into 'http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/'.
   (The utility 'wget' -- which you can find on PhysioNet -- can be helpful
   if you wish to copy an entire directory of a web site, as suggested
   here.)

3. In this directory, type:
	./configure
	make install
   You will need root permissions to run 'make install', unless you change
   WFDBROOT so that the files are installed in a directory that you own (you
   will be given a chance to do this when running 'configure').

4. If for any reason you wish to uninstall the WFDB Software Package, type:
	make uninstall
   from this directory.  You will need root permissions to uninstall unless
   you changed WFDBROOT before installing the package.

Under MS-Windows:

1. If you have not already done so, install the Cygwin development environment
   (freely available from http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/).  This includes
   gcc (the GNU C/C++ compiler) as well as a comprehensive assortment of other
   Unix utilities ported to MS-Windows.  Accept the defaults suggested by the
   installer.

   IMPORTANT:  Although you may be able to compile the WFDB software package
   using a proprietary compiler, this is NOT SUPPORTED.  The 'Makefile.dos'
   files in several of the subdirectories of this one can be used with the
   'make' utilities provided with most commercial C compilers, although you
   will need to customize them for your compiler. Your feedback is appreciated.

2. Download http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/binaries/windows/bin/which.exe
   and put it into a directory in your PATH.  (This utility is needed by
   'configure' in a later step.  The sources for which.exe are available within
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/utilities/.)

3. Open a Cygwin terminal window (the Cygwin installer will have added this to
   your MS-Windows start menu).  Check that 'which' and 'gcc' are accessible by
   typing the command:
	which gcc
   The output of this command should be:
	/usr/bin/gcc
   If you don't see this output, repeat steps 1 and 2 above as necessary to
   correct the problem before continuing.

4. Install the World Wide Web Consortium's libwww library (you will need both
   the library itself and the developer's package;  download them from
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/libwww/, or from the W3C's web site
   at http://www.w3.org/Library).  You may skip this step if you don't want
   support for reading input files from remote web and FTP servers.  See
   README.NETFILES for further information about this option.

5. In this directory (the top-level directory of the WFDB software package,
   containing the file you are now reading), type:
	./configure
	make install

6. If for any reason you wish to uninstall the WFDB Software Package, type:
	make uninstall
   from this directory.

Under MacOS or other operating systems

Sorry, but you are on your own here.  Previous versions of the WFDB library
and some of the applications have been compiled successfully by Macintosh
users (and on VMS, among other environments).  The sources are written in
highly portable C and should not be difficult to port to any environment where
an ANSI/ISO or K&R C compiler and the standard C library are available.

Several users have reported that the WFDB library and the applications in the
'app' directory can be compiled successfully using cc (gcc) under MacOS/X
(Darwin).

If you find that changes are necessary in order to compile this software
successfully, please send details to the author (george@mit.edu) so that
others can benefit from your experience.  Contributions of working binaries
are welcome, but please write first before sending them to me. Thanks!

Once you have successfully compiled and installed the WFDB Software Package,
you will find a great deal of information about using it on PhysioNet;  begin
looking in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb-books.shtml.
