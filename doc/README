This directory and its subdirectories contain documentation for the WFDB
Software Package, including UNIX man pages in troff source format for the WFDB
software and other sources for the WFDB Applications Guide (in wag-src), the
TeX (texinfo) source for the WFDB Programmer's Guide (in wpg-src), and the
LaTeX source for the WAVE User's Guide (in wug-src).  Under Unix, Linux, or
under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit, this material can be printed or
installed on-line by following the instructions in `Makefile'.

If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB Software
Package, the man pages from the wfdb-apps subdirectory will be installed so
they can be read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  If you have the necessary
formatting software, these man pages and a large amount of other documentation
can be produced in a wide variety of formats from the sources in in this
directory (see 'Makefile').  Here is a brief list of available formats and the
commands needed to produce them:

WFDB Applications Guide
  printed copy	'make wag-book'(requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, & a printer)
  HTML		'make wag.html'(requires rman, latex2html, and perl)
  man pages	'make wag.man'
  PDF		'make wag.pdf' (requires troff, tbl, latex, dvips, and pstopdf)
  PostScript	'make wag.ps'  (requires troff, tbl, latex, and dvips)

WFDB Programmer's Guide
  printed copy	'make wpg-book'(requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, and a printer)
  Windows help	'make wpg.hlp' (requires makertf and hcrtf)
  HTML		'make wpg.html'(requires texi2html and perl)
  info		'make wpg.info'(requires makeinfo or GNU emacs)
  PDF		'make wpg.pdf' (requires texi2dvi)
  PostScript	'make wpg.ps'  (requires texi2dvi and dvips)

WAVE User's Guide
  printed copy	'make wug-book'(requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make wug.html'(requires latex2html and perl)
  PDF		'make wug.pdf' (requires pdflatex)
  PostScript	'make wug.ps'  (requires latex and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).


The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile	UNIX `make' description file for printing the WFDB software
		 documentation and installing it on-line
Makefile.top	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (comments only)
Makefile.tpl	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (portable section)
README		this file

misc/		miscellaneous files for preparing formatted documentation
wag/		formatted versions of the WFDB Applications Guide [*]
wpg/		formatted versions of the WFDB Programmer's Guide [*]
wug/		formatted versions of the WAVE User's Guide [*]
wag-src/	sources for the WFDB Applications Guide
wpg-src/	sources for the WFDB Programmer's Guide
wug-src/	sources for the WAVE User's Guide

[*] These directories are empty in all distributed versions of the WFDB
    Software Package. Their contents can be generated using 'make all' in
    wag-src, wpg-src, and wug-src;  or the files may be downloaded from
