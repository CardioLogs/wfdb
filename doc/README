This directory contains UNIX man pages in troff source format for the WFDB
software, and the TeX source for the WFDB Programmer's Guide.  On a UNIX
system, this material can be printed or installed on-line by following the
instructions in `Makefile'.  Both TeX and troff are available for MS-DOS as
well.  See the beginning of `dbu.tex' for information on obtaining printed
copies of the material in this directory.
