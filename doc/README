This directory contains UNIX man pages in troff source format for the WFDB
software and other sources for the WFDB Applications Guide, the TeX (texinfo)
source for the WFDB Programmer's Guide, and the LaTeX source for the WAVE
User's Guide.  Under Unix, Linux, or under MS-Windows with the Cygwin toolkit,
this material can be printed or installed on-line by following the instructions
in `Makefile'.

If you follow the instructions for a standard installation of the WFDB Software
Package, the man pages from this directory will be installed so they can be
read using 'man', 'xman', etc.  If you have the necessary formatting software,
these man pages and a large amount of other documentation can be produced in a
wide variety of formats from the sources in in this directory (see 'Makefile').
Here is a brief list of available formats and the commands needed to produce
them:

WFDB Programmer's Guide
  printed copy	'make guide' (requires troff, texi2dvi, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make htmlpg' (requires texi2html)
  info		'make info' (requires makeinfo or GNU emacs)
  PDF		'make dbpg.pdf' (requires texi2dvi)
  PostScript	'make dbpg.ps' (requires texi2dvi and dvips)
  Windows help	'make dbu.hlp' (requires makertf and hcrtf)

WFDB Applications Guide
  printed copy	'make appguide' (requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make htmlag' (requires perl)
  PDF		'make dbag.pdf' (requires latex, troff, dvips, and pstopdf)
  PostScript	'make dbag.ps' (requires latex, troff, and dvips)

WAVE User's Guide
  printed copy	'make wguide' (requires troff, latex, dvips, and a printer)
  HTML		'make htmlag' (requires perl)
  PDF		'make dbag.pdf' (requires pdflatex)
  PostScript	'make dbag.ps' (requires latex and dvips)

All of these, with the exception of printed copies, can be downloaded from
PhysioNet (look in http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/manuals.shtml).
