.SH NAME
wrann \- write a WFDB annotation file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwrann -r \fIrecord\fB -a \fIannotator\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIWrann\fR translates its standard input into an annotation file.
The format of \fIwrann\fR input should be that produced by \fIrdann\fR(1).
Specifically, the pipeline
.br
    \fBrdann -r \fIrecord\fB -a \fIiann\fB -f 0 | wrann -r \fIrecord\fB -a
\fIoann\fR
.br
is guaranteed to produce an identical copy of the annotation file
read by \fIrdann\fR, provided that the \fBaux\fR fields of the annotations
do not contain embedded nulls.
.PP
The usual application for \fIwrann\fR is as an aid to annotation file
editing:  an annotation file may be translated into ASCII format
using \fIrdann\fR, edited using a text editor, and then translated back
into annotation file format using \fIwrann\fR.
.PP
The shell variable \fBWFDB\fR should be set and exported (see
\fIsetwfdb\fR(1)).
