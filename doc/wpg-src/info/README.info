File: README.info

These files were generated using 'makeinfo' from the texinfo source for the
WFDB Programmer's Guide (wpg.tex, included in the WFDB Software Package).

Once installed, you will be able to browse the info files (those named 'wpg',
'wpg-1', 'wpg-2', etc.) in this directory with GNU emacs, XEmacs, or GNU info.
Install at least one of these programs (free, from http://www.gnu.org/) if you
have not already done so.  Then copy the info files (excluding this README)
into your 'info' directory, which may be any of:

	/usr/info
	/usr/local/info
	/usr/share/info

or, in some older installations:

	/usr/local/emacs/info

Finally, add a link to these files from the top of the 'info' tree.  Do so by
copying the last four lines below (do not reformat them) and appending them to
the end of the 'dir' file you will find in the 'info' directory.
