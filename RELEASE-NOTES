10.2.0pre8:
	The 10.2 series differs from all earlier releases in that the WFDB
	library no longer imposes any fixed limits on the numbers of signals
	or annotators that can be open simultaneously.  See lib/wfdb.h for
	details.

	In this beta release, most of the programs in the 'app' directory have
	been revised so that they can handle arbitrary numbers of signals and
	annotation files.  In a future release in this series, the following
	programs will also be revised along the same lines:

		edf2mit
		pschart
		psfd
		wave

	as well as programs in the 'examples' directory.

	'man' pages in the 'doc' directory should be up-to-date, but the WFDB
	Programmer's Guide (doc/dbu.tex) is only partially updated.

	Also please note the new 'checkpkg' directory, which contains a variety
	of tests to check the basic functionality of the WFDB library and many
	of the WFDB applications.  From the base directory, run the tests by:

		make check

	These tests will check the currently installed version of the WFDB
	software package.  If you use them to check an old version, there may
	be minor discrepancies because of changes in the output formats;  you
	should not encounter any discrepancies if you use these tests after
	installing this version of the WFDB software package.

	As always, your comments are welcome!
