# Each release of the WFDB Software Package is identified by a three-part
# version number, defined here:
MAJOR = 10
MINOR = 2
RELEASE = 7
VERSION = $(MAJOR).$(MINOR).$(RELEASE)

# RPMRELEASE can be incremented if changes are made between official
# releases.  It should be reset to 1 whenever the VERSION is changed.
RPMRELEASE = 2

# VDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set version number variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.
VDEFS = -DWFDB_MAJOR=$(MAJOR) -DWFDB_MINOR=$(MINOR) -DWFDB_RELEASE=$(RELEASE)
