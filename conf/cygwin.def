#
# This file contains default 'make' definitions for compiling the WFDB Software
# Package under MS Windows using the free Cygwin/gcc ANSI C compiler, available
# from http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin/.
#
# To use this successfully, you need to have installed Cygwin B20 or later,
# as well as `which.exe' (which should be installed somewhere in your PATH;
# get it from http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/utilities/which/which.exe).
#
# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# If the W3C's libwww library of HTTP and FTP client code is available, and
# you wish to compile a WFDB library with NETFILES support, set LWC to
# 'libwww-config' (a utility supplied with libwww).  Otherwise set LWC to ':'
# (a program that does nothing, successfully).
LWC = libwww-config

# LDLIBWWW, which is appended to LDFLAGS below, is the set of options needed
# to link with libwww.  If libwww is not installed, or if libwfdb is a shared
# library, LDLIBWWW can be empty (if there is a '#' immediately after the '='
# below, the remainder of the line is ignored, so LDLIBWWW is empty in this
# case).  Otherwise, it is generated from the output of LWC.  Note that up to
# three passes through the option list are necessary to satisfy all
# dependencies when linking to the static libwww libraries.
LDLIBWWW = # `$(LWC) --libs` `$(LWC) --libs` `$(LWC) --libs`

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include
# Note: if you have both gcc and a vendor-supplied C compiler, and if INCDIR
# is /usr/include, CFLAGS should *not* contain -I$(INCDIR) (if it does, gcc may
# read the wrong version of files such as stdio.h when compiling WFDB
# applications).

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib

# PSPDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the PostScript
# prolog (*.pro) files from the 'app' directory.
PSPDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib/ps

# CC is the name of your C compiler.  The WFDB library can be compiled with K&R
# C compilers (`cc' on most if not all UNIX systems) as well as with ANSI C
# compilers such as GNU C (`gcc').
CC = gcc
# On systems where `gcc' is the standard C compiler, `gcc' may also be known as
# `cc'; in such cases, it doesn't matter if CC is cc or gcc.

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS.  Add the following options to CCDEFS as appropriate (separating them
# by spaces if you use more than one):
#   -DISPRINTF	  if you do not have `stdlib.h' and your `sprintf' returns an
#		   int (see wfdblib.h)
#   -DNETFILES	  if you have libwww and want to be able to access WFDB files
#		   remotely via http or ftp (as well as local files)
#   -DNOMALLOC_H  if you have neither `stdlib.h' nor `malloc.h' (see wfdblib.h)
#   -DNOSTRTOK	  if your standard C library does not include function `strtok'
#		   (see wfdbio.c)
#   -DNOTIME	  if you do not have `time.h' (see signal.c)
#   -DNOVALUES_H  if you do not have `values.h' (see psd/log10.c)
#   -DOLDC	  if you have neither `stdarg.h' nor `varargs.h' (see wfdbio.c)
# If your C compiler fails to compile `signal.c', add -DBROKEN_CC to CCDEFS
# and try again (see signal.c).
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS) -DNOVALUES_H

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options.  CFLAGS should always include
# CCDEFS.  Add the following options to CFLAGS as appropriate (separating them
# by spaces if you use more than one):
#   -g		  to save symbols for debugging
#   -O		  if you trust your C compiler's optimizer
# With the exception of `gcc', most C compilers do not allow you to use -g and
# -O simultaneously.
CFLAGS = -g $(CCDEFS) `$(LWC) --cflags` -I$(INCDIR)
# `gcc' users may comment out the previous line, and uncomment the next one.
# CFLAGS = -g -O $(CCDEFS) `$(LWC) --cflags` -I$(INCDIR)

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb $(LDLIBWWW)

# WFDBLIB is the name of the standard WFDB library.  In order to access it via
# `-lwfdb', WFDBLIB should be `libwfdb.a'.
WFDBLIB = libwfdb.a

# If your system requires indexed libraries, uncomment the next line.
RANLIB = ranlib
# Otherwise, uncomment the next line.
# RANLIB = :

# AR is the name of the command used to build a standard library from `.o'
# files, and ARFLAGS is the set of options used when doing so.  AR and ARFLAGS
# are usually `make' builtins and need not be defined here;  under HP UX, and
# perhaps other versions of UNIX, however, you will need to define these
# variables by uncommenting the next two lines.
# AR = ar
# ARFLAGS = rv

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the static WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $(WFDBLIB)

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETXPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the applications accessible.
SETXPERMISSIONS = ../conf/exechmod 755

# STRIP is the command used to compact the compiled binaries by removing their
# symbol tables.  'exestrip' is a script that appends the '.exe' suffix to the
# files in its argument list before passing their names to 'strip' itself.
STRIP = ../conf/exestrip
# To retain the symbol tables for debugging, comment out the previous line, and
# uncomment the next line.
# STRIP = :

# `make' (with no target specified) will be equivalent to `make all'.
make-all:	all

# `make lib-post-install' should be run after installing the WFDB library.
lib-post-install:
	echo "Nothing to be done for lib-post-install"

lib-post-uninstall:
	echo "Nothing to be done for lib-post-uninstall"
