# 'make' definitions for compiling the WFDB Software Package under FreeBSD
#
# Based on 'linux.def', with edits for FreeBSD thanks to Giuseppe Pagnoni.
#
# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /usr
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# If the W3C's libwww library of HTTP and FTP client code is available, and
# you wish to compile a WFDB library with NETFILES support, set LWC to
# 'libwww-config' (a utility supplied with libwww).  Otherwise set LWC to ':'
# (a program that does nothing, successfully).
LWC = libwww-config

# LDLIBWWW, which is appended to LDFLAGS below, is the set of options needed
# to link with libwww.  If libwww is not installed, or if libwfdb is a shared
# library, LDLIBWWW can be empty (if there is a '#' immediately after the '='
# below, the remainder of the line is ignored, so LDLIBWWW is empty in this
# case).  Otherwise, it is generated from the output of LWC.  Note that up to
# three passes through the option list are necessary to satisfy all
# dependencies when linking to the static libwww libraries.
LDLIBWWW = # `$(LWC) --libs` `$(LWC) --libs` `$(LWC) --libs`

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.
BINDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/bin

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.
DBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/database

# INCDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library's #include <...> files.
INCDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/include

# INFODIR is the GNU info directory (optional, needed to `make info').
INFODIR = /usr/local/info

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.
LIBDIR = $(WFDBROOT)/lib

# PSPDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the PostScript
# prolog (*.pro) files from the 'app' directory.
PSPDIR = /usr/lib/ps

# CC is the name of your C compiler.
CC = gcc

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS.
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS)

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options.  CFLAGS should always include
# CCDEFS.
CFLAGS = -g -O $(CCDEFS) `$(LWC) --cflags` -I$(INCDIR)

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb $(LDLIBWWW)

# WFDBLIB is the name of the standard WFDB library.  In order to access it via
# `-lwfdb', WFDBLIB should be `libwfdb.a'.
WFDBLIB = libwfdb.a

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the static WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $(WFDBLIB)

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETXPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the applications accessible.
SETXPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# STRIP is the command used to compact the compiled binaries by removing their
# symbol tables.
STRIP = strip
# To retain the symbol tables for debugging, comment out the previous line, and
# uncomment the next line.
# STRIP = :

# ...........................................................................
# This section of definitions is used only when compiling WAVE, which is
# possible only if the XView and Xlib libraries and include files have been
# installed.

# OPENWINHOME specifies the root directory of the OpenWindows hierarchy.
# This is usually /usr/openwin.
OPENWINHOME = /usr/openwin

# OWINCDIR is the directory in which the `xview' directory containing XView
# *.h files is found.
OWINCDIR = $(OPENWINHOME)/include

# OWLIBDIR is the directory in which the XView library is found.
OWLIBDIR = $(OPENWINHOME)/lib

# WCFLAGS is the set of C compiler options to use when compiling WAVE.
WCFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -I$(OWINCDIR)

# HELPOBJ can be set to "help.o" if you wish to recompile the XView spot help
# functions in "wave/help.c" (recommended under Linux).
# HELPOBJ = help.o
# Otherwise, use the version in libxview by uncommenting the next line:
HELPOBJ =

# WLDFLAGS is the set of loader options appended to the C compiler command line
# to specify loading the WFDB, XView, and Xlib libraries.
WLDFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(OWLIBDIR) -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lxview -lolgx -lX11
# ...........................................................................

# `make' (with no target specified) will be equivalent to `make all'.
make-all:	all

# `make lib-post-install' should be run after installing the WFDB library.
lib-post-install:
	ranlib $(LIBDIR)/$(WFDBLIB)

lib-post-uninstall:
	echo "Nothing to be done for lib-post-uninstall"
