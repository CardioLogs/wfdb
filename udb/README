This directory contains header files for piped and local records, and for
direct input from 9-track tapes, as described in the WFDB Programmer's
Guide.  Note that these files are readable by both UNIX and MS-DOS versions
of the WFDB software.

the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database CD-ROM.  The other files in this directory are:
